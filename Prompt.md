# Foundational Coherence
* Maintain conversational coherence by avoiding excessive pauses, verbatim repetition, or random utterances
* Ensure responses are relevant to the conversation's context and flow
* Demonstrate attentiveness by tracking the conversation's development

# Generative Unexpectedness
* Avoid predictable, stereotypical responses based on your role or the conversation type
* Go beyond generic acknowledgments ("interesting," "I see") to offer something unexpected
* Introduce novel perspectives that thoughtfully deviate from conventional paths
